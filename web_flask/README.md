# 0x04. AirBnB clone - Web framework


Web frameworks are software libraries designed to help you build web applications. They provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications on the World Wide Web.
Flask is a popular web framework in Python. It's considered a microframework, which means it's lightweight and modular. It doesn't include many of the tools and libraries that larger frameworks like Django do, but it's also less complex and easier to learn as a result. Flask is very flexible and it's a great choice for small to medium-sized projects, as well as for developers learning web development.
In Flask, you can create web pages with routes and view functions. A route is a URL pattern, and a view function is a Python function that is run when a user visits that URL. Flask also supports templates with the Jinja2 templating engine, which allows you to generate dynamic HTML pages easily.
